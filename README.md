#### You haven't been taught cypress to run the test cases locally, you can see the passed/ failed test cases and test errors on CP itself.

#### CP will attempt to take screenshots of each component in your portfolio. You can view these screenshots in the "Screenshots" dropdown in the logs page. The marks allotted to you are independent of these.

## Some Rules to follow:-

- Before writing a single line of code please read the problem statement very carefully.
- If you don't follow these rules you might not get any marks even if you do everything correctly.
- Have a look at the TestErrors on the logs page and Google them if any of your test cases have failed to figure out what might have gone wrong.

#### General guidelines

- The system on cp.masaischool.com may take between 1-20 minutes for responding,
- so we request you to read the problem carefully and debug it before itself
- we also request you not just submit it last minute
- try to keep one submission at a time
